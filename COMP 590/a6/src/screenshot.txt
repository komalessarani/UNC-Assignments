Avatarify is a repository on GitHub that acts like a filter on snapchat, but instead it is for zoom calls. Once you open the app,
a window will pop-up with your video (you need to use your webcam) and then from there you can personalize whatever avatar you would
like to be whether it's Elon Musk, Mona Lisa, an old picture of you, whatever you would like! It's really cool that when you talk, 
the avatar's mouth also moves with it and when you move, the avatar moves! It's a really cool and amusing project that lightens up
zoom calls!
