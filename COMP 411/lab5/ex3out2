There was an old lady who swallowed a cat;
 She swallowed the cat to catch the bird;
  She swallowed the bird to catch the spider;
   She swallowed the spider to catch the fly;
   I don't know why she swallowed a fly - Perhaps she'll die!
  I don't know why she swallowed a spider - That wriggled and jiggled and tickled inside her!
 I don't know why she swallowed a bird - How absurd to swallow a bird!
I don't know why she swallowed a cat - Imagine that! She swallowed a cat!
