There was an old lady who swallowed a horse;
 She swallowed the horse to catch the pony;
  She swallowed the pony to catch the bat;
   She swallowed the bat to catch the spider;
    She swallowed the spider to catch the moth;
     She swallowed the moth to catch the bee;
     I don't know why she swallowed a bee - Isn't that totally freaky?!
    I don't know why she swallowed a moth - Who wasn't cut from the same cloth!
   I don't know why she swallowed a spider - That wriggled and jiggled and tickled inside her!
  I don't know why she swallowed a bat - Imagine that! She swallowed a bat!
 I don't know why she swallowed a pony - I'd rather she had eaten macaroni!
I don't know why she swallowed a horse - She was going to die, of course!
