                <h2>what is a Fairy?</h2>
                <p class = "description">
                a fairy is a magical creature that resembles a human. Beyond that, every fairy comes in different colors, sizes, and temperaments.
                Their legend is as old as European civilization itself, no two fairy encounters are quite the same!
                To learn more about their physical description and characteristics, visit the <a href = "about.html">About</a> page!

                <h2>intro into Legends</h2>
                <p>
                sometimes fairies are described as assuming the guise of an animal. For instance, in Scotland, it was peculiar to the fairy woman
                to assume the shape of deer while witches became mice, hares, cats, etc. Along with Scotland, Ireland also has its own fair share 
                of fairy legends and lores. To learn more about those legends, visit the <a href = "legends.html">Legends</a> page!

                <h2>intro into Literary Appearances</h2>
                <p>
                fairies started appearing in medieval romances as one of the beings that a knight errant- a knight that wanders the land in search of 
                adventures to prove his chivalric virtues - might encounter. Fairies also Fairies appear as significant characters in William Shakespeare's 
                A Midsummer Night's Dream. To learn more about their literary appearances, visit the <a href = "literary.html">Literary Appearances</a> page!
