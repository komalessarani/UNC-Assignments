               If you saw a picture of an ancient fairy, you might mistake it for an elf or
               even a troll! The first fey people certainly weren’t as delicate as the fairies
               we know and love today. They all looked human, but they ranged from supernaturally
               beautiful to hideously deformed. Some of them had traits that clearly set them apart
               from humans like:
                <ul class ="characteristics">
                   <li>Pointed Ears</li>
                   <li>Webbed Fingers</li>
                   <li>Missing Nose</li>
                   <li>Green or Blue skin</li>
               </ul>
            <p>
               During the Romantic Period, fairies took the stage in plays and operas. Ugly fairies 
               fell out of fashion and were replaced by gorgeous creatures, whose connection to nature
               was made obvious by their flowery clothing and woodland companions. Conveniently, these new, 
               beautiful fairies were human-sized and prone to falling in love with mortals!

               During the Victorian Era, fairytales for children became popular. Fairies were shrunk down to a 
               tiny size and given adorable, tailored outfits complete with tiny shoes and hats. Fairies with wings 
               also became more popular, especially after the publication of JM Barrie’s Peter Pan.
